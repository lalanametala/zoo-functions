## Zoo Functions Project

### About
This is a project from [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s Web Development Course - Principles of Web Development Module.

Unit tests are essential for creating quality features. Learning what they are and how they should be implemented is essential for software developers.
In this project, I made the implementation of various functions to meet the proposed requirements and/or unit tests to ensure that the implementations of the functions are correct.
